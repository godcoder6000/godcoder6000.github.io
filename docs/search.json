I chose this platform specifically because of its robust capability to generate, explain, and refine code implementations—particularly for data visualization tasks in R and Quarto. The tool proved instrumental in several key areas: it helped generate properly formatted R code for creating quantitative visualizations with appropriate chart types and aesthetics; it provided clear explanations of visualization principles and best practices; it assisted in debugging code syntax errors; and it offered guidance on structuring Quarto documents with proper figure labeling and cross-referencing.\n\n\n\ndeepseek"
